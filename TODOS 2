topnavbar fixed



this is so minor, but if i review a game, the icon remains as the X until i either refresh with ctrl+r or go to another tab and go back
postmatch review LAYOUT IN FULL HD 1080 is glitched
also in the matchups note, if if type "1." then a space to make a numbered list, the number disapears but leavews the indent
ye  that all looks fine, theres little QoL stuff that can be done, FE in the learning objectives if you make one, it doesnt auto select it, it adds to the list then you need to manually select it
would be cool if the opponent updated as well, im going against brand atm but its still on azir - i think its still worth having, then someone can change it if needed
